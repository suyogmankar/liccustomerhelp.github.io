        The LIC New Children’s Money Back Plan can be bought either by the
        grandparents or the parents of the child aged between 0 to 12 years of
        age. In the simplest words, it is an insurance cum investment plan that
        will be helpful to secure the bright future of the child. On the premise
        of the performance of the plan, this participating plan is likewise
        eligible for the bonus as well. The prime reason that the LIC New
        Children’s Money Back Plan remains a preferred and opulent choice for
        the parents or the grandparents is that it provides financial security
        to the child up to 25 years of age to accomplish their milestones by
        offering them a lump sum amount along with maturity. Children are
        considered to be the future of any nation. Therefore, it is of utmost
        importance to have well-planned financial security so that finance is
        not a barrier between the child and the dreams. Let us get into the
        details of the LIC New Children Money Back Plan.
